Two pseudo codes for finding species diversity over time:

Input/Output:

xx = csv from loop containing each unique family as well as first and last occurance
yy = chronologically order xx and organize into plot
Output message saying "The plot of species diversity over time" and display the graph.


Loop Data Manipulation:

set species file to "file"
for every family in "file":
	sort into unique familes
	display first and last occurrence for each family
	send to new csv file
